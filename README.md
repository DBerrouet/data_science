I was given a data file by Ankorstore after a job interview. I added the column net margin which obeyed the rules given by the recruiter 
(Ankorstore revenues - payment cost - shipping cost - discount). 
I also added a boolean IsProfitable which is equal to 1 if the Net Margin is positive and 0 if negative.

I'll figure I'll use this dataset to do a few data science exercice :).
The first objective will be to make a decision tree to check which feature we should look after to get a profitible order.
More exercise should come after.
